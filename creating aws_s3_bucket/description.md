# Creating an S3 Bucket Using Terraform  

This guide provides a step-by-step process to create an **AWS S3 bucket** using Terraform. It covers everything from **setting up AWS credentials** to **applying Terraform configurations** in a structured way.  

---

## **Prerequisites**  

Before you begin, ensure you have completed the following:  

### **1. Create an AWS IAM User with Administrator Access**  

To interact with AWS via Terraform, you need an **IAM (Identity & Access Management) user** with the right permissions.  

- Sign in to the **[AWS Management Console](https://aws.amazon.com/console/)**.  
- Navigate to **IAM (Identity & Access Management)** â†’ **Users** â†’ **Create a User**.  
- Assign **AdministratorAccess** permissions to the user.  
- Generate an **Access Key ID** and **Secret Access Key** (these will be used for authentication).  

ðŸ“Œ **Official Documentation**: [AWS IAM Users](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/id_users_create.html)

### **2. Install AWS CLI & Configure Credentials**  

The AWS Command Line Interface (CLI) allows Terraform to authenticate with AWS services.  

#### **Install AWS CLI**  
- Download and install AWS CLI: **[Installation Guide](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/userguide/install-cliv2.html)**.  
- Verify installation:  
  ```sh
  aws --version
Configure AWS CLI
Run the following command to configure AWS CLI with your credentials:

sh
Copy
Edit
aws configure
It will prompt you to enter:

Access Key ID
Secret Access Key
Default AWS Region (e.g., eu-west-1)
Default Output Format (json or leave blank)

3. Install Terraform
Terraform is an Infrastructure-as-Code (IaC) tool used to provision AWS resources.

Install Terraform
Download and install Terraform: Installation Guide.
Verify installation:
sh
Copy
Edit
terraform -v
ðŸ“Œ Official Documentation: Terraform Installation

Step 1: Define the AWS Provider
Terraform needs a provider to interact with AWS. Create a new file terraform_provider.tf and add the following code:

hcl
Copy
Edit
terraform {
  required_providers {
    aws = {
      source  = "hashicorp/aws"
      version = "5.88.0"
    }
  }
}

provider "aws" {
  region = "eu-west-1"
}
Explanation
The terraform block defines the AWS provider and its version.
The provider "aws" block configures Terraform to use AWS in the eu-west-1 region.

Step 2: Create an S3 Bucket with Terraform
Create a new file awsS3.tf and add the following code:

hcl
Copy
Edit
resource "aws_s3_bucket" "first_bucket" {
  bucket = "gosom-dev-tera"

  tags = {
    Name        = "gosom-dev-tera"
    Environment = "Dev"
  }
}
Explanation
This block defines an S3 bucket named gosom-dev-tera.
Tags help in identifying and managing resources efficiently.

Step 3: Initialize and Apply Terraform
1. Initialize Terraform
Terraform needs to download the required provider plugins before execution. Run:

sh
Copy
Edit
terraform init
2. Preview Terraform Changes
Before making actual changes, check the execution plan:

sh
Copy
Edit
terraform plan
3. Apply Terraform Configuration
To create the S3 bucket, apply the Terraform script:

sh
Copy
Edit
terraform apply
Type yes when prompted to confirm.

ðŸ“Œ Official Documentation: Terraform CLI Commands

Step 4: Verify the S3 Bucket in AWS Console
Once Terraform has applied the configuration, you can verify the bucket:

Go to the AWS S3 Console: AWS S3.
Check if the bucket gosom-dev-tera has been created.
Step 5: Destroy Terraform Resources (Optional)
If you no longer need the S3 bucket, you can remove it using:

sh
Copy
Edit
terraform destroy
Type yes when prompted to confirm.

Conclusion
This guide walks through the entire process of setting up an AWS S3 bucket using Terraform, covering:

AWS IAM and CLI setup
Terraform provider configuration
S3 bucket creation
Applying and verifying Terraform scripts
By following these steps, you can automate AWS infrastructure provisioning efficiently.
